 will not be updated automatically, it’s saved as the current values. But manual input is allowed. 1：One of the self-adaptive notch filter is effective, the 3rd notch parameter will be updated automatically, manual input is not allowed. 2：Two  of  the  self-adaptive  notch  filter  is  effective,  the  3rd  and  4th  notch parameter will be updated automatically, manual input is not allowed. 3：Detect resonance frequency only 4：Clear the 3rd and 4th notch parameters and restore to default value. P08-13 Self-adaptive notch filter vibration detect door limit  Setting range：0-7 This  parameter  sets  the  sensitivity  of  the  self-adaptive  notch  vibration detection. The smaller the parameter value, the more sensitive the detection sensitivity is. B.  Setting the notch parameters manually a) The resonance frequency of the mechanical system can be observed through monitoring items d26.1.Fr, d28.2.Fr b) Enter the resonance frequency from the previous step into the notch parameters, simultaneously input the width level and depth level of the same notch teams. c) If the vibration is suppressed, it means the notch is functioning. You can continue to increase the gain and repeat the previous two steps after new vibrations appear. d) If the vibration cannot be removed for a long time,    turn off the servo ENA in time.
